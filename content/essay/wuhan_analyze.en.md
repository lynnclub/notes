## Dimensions

1. Division: Hankou and Wuchang don't seem like one city. Hankou Riverside municipal government and Wuchang Fruit Lake provincial government have inconsistent goals - one promotes Yangtze River New City, the other uses the whole province's strength to build Optics Valley;
2. Geography: Rivers and lakes fragmented, inconvenient transportation, islands everywhere, especially transportation from Wuchang to Optics Valley is very inconvenient; Central city cluster too weak and scattered, not even as good as western Chengdu + Chongqing;
3. Governance: First-tier city potential, third-tier city coordination; keen on spreading pancakes, extensive imbalance; addicted to land finance with loose regulation; grassroots governance capability lags coastal areas by 20-30 years;
4. System: Second son of the Republic, deeply bound by institutions, state-owned enterprise monopoly, large rent-seeking space, squeezing private economy;
5. Employment: Million college students in involution, lacking high-paying positions, can't retain talent;
