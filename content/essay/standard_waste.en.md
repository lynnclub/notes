Today while eating takeout, I noticed a phenomenon that sparked my thinking: regardless of whether the dish has soup or liquid food, merchants often provide spoons in disposable tableware.

Why provide disposable spoons when they're obviously not needed?

From the merchant's profit perspective, even if a spoon only costs a few cents, it could be saved. Why not save it?
