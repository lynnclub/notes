Philosophy is a discipline that explores fundamental questions and basic concepts, usually involving deep thinking and philosophical reflection on existence, knowledge, values, morality, thinking, and reality. It is a way of exploring human thought and experience, aiming to find deep understanding about the world and life.

The main fields of philosophy include:

1. **Metaphysics**: Studies the nature of reality and the essence of existence, exploring questions of how to answer "what is real" and "what exists".

2. **Ethics**: Studies moral values and behavioral standards, exploring what is good and evil and how humans should behave.

3. **Epistemology**: Studies the nature of knowledge, belief and doubt, exploring how we know things and how to judge truth.

4. **Political Philosophy**: Studies the nature of government, power and social organization, exploring issues of fairness and justice.

5. **Aesthetics**: Studies the nature of art, beauty and aesthetic experience, exploring what is beautiful and the value of art.

6. **Logic**: Studies the rules of reasoning and argumentation, helping us understand and evaluate the validity of thinking.

Philosophers use logical thinking and philosophical methods to analyze complex problems, explore abstract thoughts, propose philosophical arguments, and try to answer some fundamental questions, such as the meaning of life, free will versus determinism, the reliability of knowledge, etc. Philosophy is not only a discipline but also a way of thinking that can help people understand themselves and the world more deeply. Therefore, philosophy is considered an important thinking and learning tool that can cultivate critical thinking and the ability to solve complex problems.
