Lynn's Notes is the result of Lynn's learning and thinking.

Lynn is a person who loves to dream and is also good at dreaming. His dreams are rich and colorful, full of imagination, with free flying and panicked escaping, with earthly wonderlands and demons and ghosts, with old friends still there and feeling like a lifetime has passed...... He is such an imaginative person who likes to be unconventional and doesn't like to follow rules.

Since childhood, he has been full of curiosity about this world, persistent in exploring the truth in the fog, and his interests can be roughly divided into mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology principles and other aspects surrounding real life, as well as human psychology, behavior and society, and some whimsical ideas, with special attention to the microscopic physics that forms all things. Therefore, he has constructed an encyclopedia-like knowledge map in his mind.

Based on this extensive knowledge map, he can often see the duality and correlation of things. He has relatively deep thinking, relatively long-term vision, and relatively comprehensive perspective in some aspects. Maybe he cannot do his best in subdivided fields, but integration and comprehension will always have value.

He is not good at speaking or remembering, and cannot express one-tenth of his inner wisdom through verbal communication, so he has developed the habit of written recording and summarizing. However, he rarely shows himself completely to others, and often prefers to be a listener and observer, enjoying the loneliness and tranquility of his heart.

Now (September 2023), he feels he has seen enough, and he wants to do something, perhaps without much meaning.

Just go ahead and do it, everything has meaning!
