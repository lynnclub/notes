Lynn's Notes is the result of Lynn's learning and thinking.

Lynn is a person who loves to dream and is also good at dreaming. His dreams are rich and colorful, full of imagination, with free flying and panicked escaping, with earthly wonderlands and demons and ghosts, with old friends still there and feeling like a lifetime has passed... He is such an imaginative person who likes to be unconventional and dislikes following rules and conventions.

Since childhood, he has been full of curiosity about the world, persistently exploring the truth hidden in the fog. His interests can be roughly divided into aspects surrounding real life such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biological principles, as well as human psychology, behavior and society, plus some wild ideas, with special focus on the microscopic physics that forms all things. Therefore, he has built an encyclopedic knowledge graph in his mind.

Based on his extensive knowledge graph, he can often see the duality and correlation of things. He has relatively deep thoughts in some aspects, relatively long-term vision, and relatively comprehensive perspectives. Perhaps he cannot be the best in specific fields, but integration and synthesis will always have value.

He is not good at speaking or memorizing. He cannot express even one-tenth of his inner qualities through verbal communication, so he has developed the habit of written recording and summarizing. However, he rarely shows his complete self to others, often preferring to be a listener and observer, enjoying the loneliness and tranquility of his heart.

Now (September 2023), he feels he has seen enough. He wants to do something, perhaps not of great significance.

Just go ahead and do it, everything has meaning!
