# Chapter One: Planar Composition

Tutorial references: [https://www.zhihu.com/question/22047942](https://www.zhihu.com/question/22047942)

## I. Formal Elements of Planes

Point, line, and plane are the basic elements that constitute visual space and are the formal elements of planar composition. Due to the various different combinations and effects of point, line, and plane, multiple different expression techniques and images are produced.

### 1.1 Point

In geometric terms, a point is the smallest visible unit form, with no direction, size, or shape.

Points produce different visual effects and psychological effects due to differences in size, form, and position.

1. Circle: Stable, full, solid and powerful.
2. Square: Stable, dignified, generous feeling, solid, reliable.
3. Triangle or diamond: Directional, emotionally biased, purposeful. Diamonds are more symmetrical than triangles, seeking individuality in balance. Other irregular shapes appear rich in personality, independent, and assertive. They become very obvious among regular shapes and are often used to enrich the picture.

The position of points in space also causes different psychological reactions. Certainly, suspended and sinking points bring completely different psychological feelings.

1. Bottom position: Settling feeling, quiet and low-key, not easily discovered
2. Top position: Conforms to people's visual reading order
3. Center position: Stable, steady, strong sense of concentration
4. Golden ratio point: Better attracts attention, layout has more compositional formality.

### 1.1.1 Single Point

A single point appearing center-left in the frame appears quiet and low-key. At the same time, the frame has extensive white space, forming contrast with the point, giving the frame a strong sense of tranquility.

### 1.1.2 Scattered Points

Using basic techniques like cutting and decomposition, breaks up overall image objects; forming scattered dispersed points can create unique visual effects in the frame, while points maintain overall feeling in dispersion.

### 1.1.3 Dense Points

Using dense points can make focus more concentrated, achieving the purpose of attracting eyeballs. Rhythmically arranging dense points gives people a sense of visual balance.

### 1.1.4 Free Points

Free points are used more flexibly, their free combination shows casual scattered feeling, easily making frames appear lively and vivid.

### 1.2 Linearization of Points

### 1.3 Surface Formation of Points

## 1.2 Line

## 1.3 Plane

## II. Compositional Forms

No need to learn art, hand drawing, CAD at all. Only need Cool Home 3D for software. Theory only needs to learn design process, design principles, materials, lighting and circuits, water supply and drainage, construction techniques and crafts.
