## Phone vs Camera

In 2022, phone pixels are getting higher and higher, even exceeding cameras. However, when you zoom in on phone photos, you can see heavy algorithmic smearing traces from the pixels, which are as distorted as oil paintings, to put it dramatically. As a general-purpose device, phones have insufficient light intake and can only compensate with algorithms. The professional status of cameras will still not be shaken.

## Key Points

Three elements of light play: aperture, shutter, sensitivity (ISO)
Focal length: longer focal length shoots farther, 35mm and 50mm generally for portraits. Standard zoom lenses are suitable for beginners to practice, 24-105, prime lenses have better image quality than zoom.
Second-hand: buttons on camera body must not malfunction; lenses must not have mold or dust; CMOS must not have any scratches or dust that can't be blown away; test for dead pixels by photographing white walls.
