## Common Languages

C/C++: The grandfather, high performance, enduring, industry foundation.
Java: Cross-platform virtual machine, secure, main force in education and employment, verbose.
JavaScript: An anomaly based on prototype chains, started with browsers, covers both frontend and backend, can penetrate desktop through Electron, penetrate mobile through Ionic and React Native.
TypeScript: JavaScript superset, strong typing, compiles to JS, clearer code logic.
NodeJS: Server-side JavaScript, built-in JS engine, nvm version management, npm package management.
Python: Universal glue, simple and easy to use, started with scientific research.
PHP: Elephant toolkit, feature-rich, suitable for agile web development, not suitable for low-level work.
Go: High throughput, modern, simple and efficient, supports C mixed programming and WebAssembly, high ceiling.
Lua: Lightweight, embedded glue.
Kotlin: Multi-platform all-rounder, launched by JetBrains, covers frontend and backend, also supports mobile, can compile to Java bytecode, JavaScript, or binary.
Dart: Google's language designed for clients, intended to replace JavaScript, supports iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux six platforms through Flutter 3.
Ruby: Mac built-in script, rvm version management, gem package management.
Rust: Efficient, reliable, balances development and execution efficiency, ecosystem maturity not as good as Go, supports WebAssembly.

## Data Types

### Python3

1. Number: int, float, bool, complex
2. String
3. List
4. Tuple: Immutable list
5. Set
6. Dictionary: Key-value mapping type

Immutable: Number, String, Tuple;
Mutable: List, Dictionary, Set.

### Java

Basic Data Types

1. byte: Equivalent to int8
2. short: int16
3. int: int32
4. long: int64
5. float: float32
6. double: float64
7. boolean
8. char: Single 16-bit Unicode character
9. Array: Used to store fixed-size elements of the same type

Advanced Data Structures

String: Created based on String class, belongs to objects
Enumeration
BitSet
Vector
Stack
Dictionary
Hashtable
Properties
ArrayList: Dynamically modifiable array
LinkedList
HashMap: Key-value hash table
HashSet: Collection based on HashMap implementation that doesn't allow duplicate elements
Iterator: Methods for accessing collections, can be used to iterate through collections like ArrayList and HashSet.
Generics: Combination of multiple types.

### Dart Built-in Types (Everything is an object)

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. List (also called Array)
5. Map
6. Set
7. Rune (for representing Unicode characters in strings)
8. Symbol (identifier)
